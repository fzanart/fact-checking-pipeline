Q: I'll believe in climate change when elitists stop building mansions on the coast.
A: climate change scientific consensus

Q: Global Warming? Tell that to the southern districts that woke up to negative 10 degrees this morning.
A: global warming weather vs climate

Q: More than 31,000 American scientists signed a statement saying they disagree with alarmist predictions.
A: scientific consensus on climate change qualifications

Q: Who denies that CO2 lags temperature in the ice core data by as much as 800 years and hence is a product of climate change not a cause?
A: CO2 lag temperature ice core data climate feedback

Q: CO2 is incapable of causing climatic warming by itself. CO2 makes up only 0.038% of the atmosphere and accounts for only a few percent of the greenhouse gas effect.'
A: impact of CO2 trace gas on global warming greenhouse effect

Q: Climate changes without any help from us. Has for millions of years and as we can expect, always will with Ice Ages occurring during about 90 percent of the time.

Q: I'll believe in climate change when elitists stop building mansions on the coast.
A: The statement claims that if climate advocates' actions are inconsistent with their arguments, their arguments must be invalid. Therefore, the argument for climate action can be disregarded. The keyword search could be: climate change scientific consensus

Q: Global Warming? Tell that to the southern districts that woke up to negative 10 degrees this morning.
A: The statement claims that if global warming was happening, we wouldn't experience cold events. The keyword search could be: global warming weather vs climate

Q: More than 31,000 American scientists signed a statement saying they disagree with alarmist predictions.
A: The statement claims that scientists are experts on climate change regardless of their field of expertise. There's no scientific consensus on human-caused global warming. The keyword search could be: scientific consensus on climate change qualifications

Q: Who denies that CO2 lags temperature in the ice core data by as much as 800 years and hence is a product of climate change not a cause?
A: The statement claims that if temperature affects CO2, then CO2 cannot affect temperature. Therefore CO2 does not drive temperature. The keyword search could be: CO2 lag temperature ice core data climate feedback

Q: CO2 is incapable of causing climatic warming by itself. CO2 makes up only 0.038% of the atmosphere and accounts for only a few percent of the greenhouse gas effect.'
A: The statement claims if there is a small percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere, its warming potential is low. Therefore CO2 cannot be the main cause of global warming. The keyword search could be: impact of CO2 trace gas on global warming greenhouse effect

Q: Climate changes without any help from us. Has for millions of years and as we can expect, always will with Ice Ages occurring during about 90 percent of the time.
A: The statement claims that what caused climate change in the past must be the same as what's causing climate change now. Therefore, current climate change must be natural. The keyword search could be: human-caused vs natural climate change
